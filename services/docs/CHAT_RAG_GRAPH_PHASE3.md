# Chat RAG Graph Phase 3 Implementation

This document outlines the Phase 3 implementation of the Chat RAG Graph solution, which builds upon the completed Phase 1 and Phase 2 implementations. Phase 3 focuses on advanced features, performance optimization, and integration with dome-api.

## 1. Advanced Features

### 1.1 Dynamic Widening

The `dynamicWiden` node has been enhanced with sophisticated logic that intelligently adjusts search parameters based on query characteristics:

- **Widening Strategies**: Multiple strategies are now available:

  - **Semantic Widening**: Expands search to include semantically related terms
  - **Temporal Widening**: Adjusts date ranges to include more historical content
  - **Relevance Widening**: Progressively reduces relevance thresholds
  - **Category Widening**: Expands to related categories
  - **Synonym Widening**: Includes synonyms and related terms

- **Intelligent Parameter Adjustment**: The system analyzes query characteristics and previous results to determine the most appropriate widening strategy.

- **Progressive Widening**: Parameters are adjusted incrementally based on the number of widening attempts, ensuring a gradual expansion of the search scope.

- **Feedback Mechanisms**: The system tracks successful retrievals to learn and improve future widening strategies.

### 1.2 Tool Registry and Execution

A comprehensive tool system has been implemented:

- **Tool Registry**: A central registry for managing available tools, with support for:

  - Tool registration and discovery
  - Parameter validation
  - Category-based organization
  - Documentation generation for LLM context

- **Tool Router**: Enhanced with:

  - Intent-based tool selection using LLM
  - Confidence scoring for tool selection
  - Parameter extraction from natural language queries
  - Fallback mechanisms for handling ambiguous queries

- **Run Tool Node**: Improved with:

  - Robust error handling
  - Retry logic with exponential backoff
  - Timeout handling
  - Fallback mechanisms for tool failures
  - Detailed logging and observability

- **Default Tools**: Several default tools are provided:
  - Calculator: Performs mathematical calculations
  - Weather: Retrieves weather information
  - Web Search: Searches the web for information
  - Calendar: Retrieves calendar events

## 2. Performance Optimization

Several performance optimizations have been implemented:

- **Caching System**: A flexible in-memory caching system with:

  - TTL-based expiration
  - LRU eviction policy
  - Size limits to prevent memory issues
  - Cache statistics for monitoring
  - Support for different cache instances for different data types

- **Token Optimization**: Prompts are now more efficient, reducing token usage while maintaining effectiveness.

- **Resource Management**: The system now includes:
  - Timeout handling for external calls
  - Retry logic with exponential backoff
  - Resource limits to prevent overuse
  - Graceful degradation under load

## 3. Integration with dome-api

The Chat RAG Graph has been integrated with dome-api:

- **Direct RPC Integration**: The dome-api now communicates directly with the chat-orchestrator using RPC instead of HTTP fetch.

- **Client Implementation**: A dedicated client for the chat-orchestrator has been created to facilitate communication.

- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling ensures that failures in the chat-orchestrator don't affect the dome-api.

## 4. Testing and Observability

The implementation includes comprehensive testing and observability features:

- **Integration Tests**: Tests for all new advanced features, ensuring they work as expected.

- **Observability**: Enhanced logging and metrics collection for:

  - Node execution times
  - Token usage
  - Cache hit/miss rates
  - Tool execution statistics
  - Error rates and types

- **Tracing**: Distributed tracing across the entire request flow, from dome-api to chat-orchestrator and back.
