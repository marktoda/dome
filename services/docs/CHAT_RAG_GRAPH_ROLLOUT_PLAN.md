# Chat RAG Graph Direct Migration Plan

This document outlines the direct migration plan for the Chat RAG Graph implementation, replacing the previous gradual rollout approach with a complete cutover strategy.

## 1. Migration Strategy Overview

The migration will follow a direct cutover approach to quickly transition all traffic to the new Chat RAG Graph implementation. This approach eliminates the complexity of maintaining dual implementations and traffic shifting mechanisms.

### 1.1 Migration Timeline

```
Week 1: Preparation and Testing
Week 2: Deployment and Monitoring
Week 3: Optimization and Documentation
```

## 2. Migration Steps

### 2.1 Preparation Phase

1. **Final Testing**

   - Complete all unit tests
   - Complete all integration tests
   - Perform load testing
   - Verify all edge cases

2. **Deployment Preparation**
   - Create deployment scripts
   - Prepare rollback scripts
   - Update monitoring configuration
   - Brief all stakeholders

### 2.2 Deployment Phase

1. **Remove Traffic Shifting Mechanism**

   - Delete `services/dome-api/src/utils/trafficShifter.ts`
   - Remove any references to traffic shifting in the codebase

2. **Update Controllers**

   - Modify the ChatController to exclusively use the chat-orchestrator service
   - Remove any conditional logic that checks for feature flags or traffic percentages

3. **Remove Legacy Implementation**

   - Delete the old ChatService implementation
   - Remove any unused imports, types, or utilities
   - Update tests to only test the new implementation

4. **Update Documentation**
   - Remove references to gradual rollout
   - Update operational documentation

### 2.3 Post-Deployment Phase

1. **Monitoring**

   - Monitor system performance
   - Track error rates
   - Collect user feedback

2. **Optimization**

   - Address any performance issues
   - Optimize resource usage
   - Fine-tune configuration

3. **Documentation**
   - Update all technical documentation
   - Create knowledge base articles
   - Update training materials

## 3. Monitoring Strategy

### 3.1 Performance Metrics

- Average response time
- 95th percentile response time
- 99th percentile response time
- Time to first token
- Tokens per second

### 3.2 Error Metrics

- Total error count
- Error rate
- Errors by type
- Errors by node

### 3.3 Resource Usage Metrics

- Memory usage
- CPU usage
- Token count
- D1 database operations

## 4. Rollback Procedure

In case of critical issues, the following rollback procedure will be implemented:

1. **Identify Issue**

   - Determine the severity of the issue
   - Assess impact on users
   - Decide whether rollback is necessary

2. **Execute Rollback**

   - Deploy the previous version
   - Verify system functionality
   - Notify stakeholders

3. **Post-Rollback Analysis**
   - Investigate root cause
   - Develop fix
   - Test fix thoroughly
   - Schedule new deployment

## 5. Success Criteria

The migration will be considered successful when:

### 5.1 Performance Criteria

- P95 response time below 2000ms
- Average TTFT below 500ms
- Average TPS above 20

### 5.2 Error Criteria

- Error rate below 1%
- No critical errors
- No system outages

### 5.3 User Experience Criteria

- Positive user feedback
- No significant usability issues
- Feature parity with previous implementation

### 5.4 Operational Criteria

- All monitoring in place
- Documentation updated
- Team trained on new implementation

## 6. Communication Plan

### 6.1 Stakeholder Updates

- Pre-deployment briefing
- Deployment notification
- Post-deployment status update
- Final success report

### 6.2 User Communication

- Announcement of upcoming changes
- Deployment notification
- Feedback collection
- Post-deployment announcement

### 6.3 Team Communication

- Daily standups during deployment week
- Slack channel for real-time updates
- Email notifications for critical issues
- Post-deployment review meeting

## 8. Conclusion

This direct migration plan provides a structured approach to transitioning all traffic to the new Chat RAG Graph implementation in a single cutover. By following this plan, we can quickly realize the benefits of the new implementation while ensuring system stability and performance.

The plan includes specific success criteria, monitoring strategies, rollback procedures, and clear communication plans. By carefully executing each step and addressing any issues promptly, we can ensure a successful migration to the new implementation.
