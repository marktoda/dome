# Search Optimization: Properly Utilizing Constellation Filters

## Issue Description

The dome-api search endpoint was not properly utilizing Constellation's filter capabilities. Instead of passing filters directly to Constellation, it was retrieving all results and then post-filtering them in the application code. This approach was inefficient and could potentially return too many results before filtering.

## Changes Implemented

1. **Proper Type Safety**: 
   - Added proper type validation and casting for the category and mimeType filters
   - Ensured the values match the expected enum types in VectorMeta

2. **Direct Constellation Filtering**:
   - Now properly passing category and mimeType filters directly to Constellation
   - Validated that category values match the allowed ContentCategory enum values
   - Removed redundant post-filtering for these attributes

3. **Retained Date Range Filtering**:
   - Kept post-filtering for date ranges as Constellation doesn't directly support these filters yet
   - Date filtering will still happen in the application code for now

4. **Improved Logging**:
   - Enhanced logging to include original filter values for better debugging
   - Added more context to logs to help diagnose filter-related issues

## Benefits

1. **Performance**: More efficient queries by pushing filtering down to the database level
2. **Reduced Data Transfer**: Less data being transferred between services
3. **Improved Type Safety**: Better type validation for filter values
4. **Cleaner Code**: Removed redundant filtering logic

## Future Improvements

1. Work with the Constellation team to add support for date range filtering directly in the service
2. Add proper validation for filter values at the API level
3. Consider adding a more comprehensive filter schema with nested filters and operators

## Technical Notes

The VectorMeta interface defines the following filter fields:
```typescript
export interface VectorMeta {
  userId: string;
  contentId: string;
  category: ContentCategory; // Enum: 'note' | 'code' | 'document' | 'article' | 'other'
  mimeType: MimeType;        // Various MIME types
  createdAt: number;
  version: number;
}
```

Constellation query method signature:
```typescript
query(text: string, filter?: Partial<VectorMeta>, topK?: number): Promise<VectorSearchResult[]>
