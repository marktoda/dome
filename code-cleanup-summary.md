- Updated wrangler from v3 to v4 in dome-cron

## 4. Test Improvements

- Fixed failing tests in the logging package
- Improved test reliability by making assertions more flexible
- Enhanced Cloudflare Workers environment mocking
- Standardized mocking patterns across test files
- Added more comprehensive test cases

## 5. Next Steps

While we've made significant improvements, there are still some areas that could benefit from further cleanup:

1. **Dependency Updates**: Continue updating dependencies to their latest versions
2. **Test Coverage**: Add more tests to increase coverage
3. **Documentation**: Add more comprehensive documentation for the entire project
4. **Error Handling**: Further standardize error handling patterns across services
5. **Type Safety**: Continue improving type definitions across the codebase

## Conclusion

The code cleanup has significantly improved the quality, maintainability, and reliability of the Dome-CF project. The standardized configurations, enhanced documentation, and improved error handling will make it easier for developers to work with the codebase in the future.
