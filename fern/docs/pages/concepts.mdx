The Dome API revolves around several key concepts that enable its AI-powered exobrain functionalities. Understanding these will help you effectively integrate with our services.

### User

A **User** represents an individual interacting with the Dome API. Each user has a unique identifier, authentication credentials, and associated data such as notes and chat history. User authentication is managed via JWTs (JSON Web Tokens).

### Note

A **Note** is a piece of textual information stored by a user. Notes can be created, retrieved, updated, deleted, and searched. They form a core part of the user's personal knowledge base within the exobrain.

### Chat Session

A **Chat Session** facilitates real-time, AI-powered conversations. Users can initiate chat sessions, send messages, and receive intelligent responses. Chat interactions can leverage the user's notes and other ingested content for context-aware replies. Communication primarily occurs over WebSockets.

### Content & Ingestion

**Content** refers to external data that can be brought into the Dome system to enrich the user's exobrain. This can include documents, web pages, or data from other platforms (e.g., Notion).
**Ingestion** is the process of importing and processing this external content, making it searchable and available for AI interactions.

### Search

The **Search** functionality allows users to query across their notes and ingested content. The search is designed to be intelligent, understanding natural language queries and providing relevant results from the user's exobrain.

### Authentication

**Authentication** is handled via Bearer Tokens (JWTs). Most endpoints require a valid token to be included in the `Authorization` header. The API provides endpoints for login, registration, token validation, and token refresh.
