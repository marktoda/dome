description: Officially supported SDKs for the Dome API to accelerate your integration.
---

We provide official open-source SDKs (Software Development Kits) to help you integrate with the Dome API quickly and reliably. These client libraries are generated directly from our OpenAPI specification using [Fern](https://buildwithfern.com/) and are available for popular languages.

Using our SDKs can significantly speed up your development process, reduce boilerplate code, and help avoid common integration errors. We regularly update our SDKs and adhere to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) (semver) principles, ensuring that minor and patch releases will not introduce breaking changes.

## Official SDKs

Below are the currently available official SDKs for the Dome API.

<CodeBlocks>

```shell TypeScript/JavaScript (npm)
# For Node.js, Bun, or frontend projects
npm install @dome/sdk # or yarn add @dome/sdk or pnpm add @dome/sdk
```

```typescript TypeScript/JavaScript (Usage Example)
import { DomeClient } from "@dome/sdk";

const dome = new DomeClient({
  environment: "https://dome-api.chatter-9999.workers.dev", // Or your self-hosted URL
  token: "YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN" // Obtained from /auth/login
});

async function getMyNotes() {
  try {
    const notesResponse = await dome.silo.listNotes(); // Example endpoint
    console.log("My Notes:", notesResponse.notes);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching notes:", error);
  }
}

getMyNotes();
```

```shell Python (pip)
# Python SDK (Illustrative - replace with actual package name if available)
pip install dome-sdk-py 
```

```python Python (Usage Example)
# Python SDK (Illustrative - replace with actual client usage if available)
from dome_sdk_py import DomeClient # Assuming this structure

dome = DomeClient(
    base_url="https://dome-api.chatter-9999.workers.dev",
    token="YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN"
)

try:
    notes_response = dome.silo.list_notes() # Example endpoint
    print(f"My Notes: {notes_response.notes}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error fetching notes: {e}")

```

</CodeBlocks>

The `@dome/sdk` for TypeScript/JavaScript is actively maintained and is the recommended way to interact with the Dome API from Node.js or browser environments. For other languages, please check our GitHub repository or refer to the "Request a new SDK" section.

## SDK Features

Our SDKs typically provide:
- Type safety for requests and responses.
- Easy-to-use methods for all API endpoints.
- Automatic handling of authentication headers (once configured with a token).
- Retries and error handling (depending on the specific SDK).

## Request a new SDK

If you require an SDK for a language not currently supported, please [let us know by opening an issue on our GitHub repository](/welcome#get-support) (link to be updated on the Welcome page). We prioritize SDK development based on community demand and are always looking to expand our offerings.
