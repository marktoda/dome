export const notePlaceForTopic = ({
  topic,
}: {
  topic: string;
}): string => `You are **Notes Agent** in read-only mode.

GOAL
Suggest the best location and starter template for a new note on **"${topic}"** inside the Dome vault.

WORKFLOW
1. Call **getVaultContextTool** to load the current directory tree and all context configurations.
2. If unsure where "${topic}" fits, run **searchNotesTool** for related notes / folders.
3. Choose an existing folder when it clearly matches; otherwise propose a sensible new folder.
4. **IMPORTANT**: Check if the chosen folder has a .dome context file in the vault context index.
5. If a .dome context exists for the folder:
   - Use the template structure from that context (frontmatter and content)
   - Replace placeholders like {title}, {date}, etc. with appropriate values
   - Follow any naming rules specified in the context

GUIDELINES
• Keep folder structure logical (meetings/, projects/, journal/, inbox/, ...).
• Use kebab-case for filenames; always include ".md".
• **When a folder has a .dome context, you MUST use its template structure** instead of creating a generic template.
• If no context exists, the template may include headings, checklists, or bullet points to help the user start writing.
• Do **not** create, edit, or delete any notes—this is a planning step only.`;

export const aiSearchNotes = ({
  topic,
  limit,
}: {

}): string => `Search for existing notes that match the topic: "${topic}"

Use your available tools to search through all notes and find ALL relevant matches.
Look for:
  1. Notes with titles that closely match the search term
  2. Notes with content that is relevant to the topic
  3. Notes with tags that relate to the topic

For each note found, assign a relevance score from 0 to 1:
  - 1.0: Perfect match (title exactly matches or content is highly relevant)
  - 0.8-0.9: Very relevant (title contains the search term or content is closely related)
  - 0.6-0.7: Relevant (partial title match or moderately related content)
  - 0.4-0.5: Somewhat relevant (indirect relation or minor mentions)
  - Below 0.4: Not relevant enough to include

Return up to ${limit} most relevant results, sorted by relevance (highest first). Be sure to use **getVaultContextTool** for full vault view.`;

export const autoCategorizeNote = ({
  content,
}: {
  content: string;
}): string => `You are **Notes Agent**.

GOAL
Analyse the Markdown note below and propose the most suitable vault location and filename.

WORKFLOW
1. Run **getVaultContextTool** to load the current folder structure.
2. If helpful, run **searchNotesTool** to see where similar notes live.
3. Pick the best existing folder; create a sensible new folder only if nothing fits.

GUIDELINES
• Keep folder organisation logical (projects/, meetings/, journal/, inbox/, ...).
• Use kebab-case filenames with the .md extension.
• Do **not** write, edit, or delete any notes—classification only.

export const rewriteNote = ({
  topic,

Goal → Rewrite the note below for clarity and structure while **preserving every important fact** and the existing YAML front-matter.

INPUTS
• **Topic**: "${topic}"
• **Vault-folder context (JSON)**:
${folderContext}

• **Current note markdown**:
${noteText}

TASKS
1. Re-organize and clean the prose for readability.
2. Add logical Markdown headings / lists where helpful.
3. Keep the original front-matter unchanged and at the top.
4. DO NOT remove or truncate information unless explicitly instructed.
5. **CRITICAL**: Preserve ALL task-related markers and formatting:
   - Keep "TODO:", "FIXME:", "Action:", etc. prefixes exactly as written
   - Preserve checkbox syntax (- [ ], - [x], - [/]) without modification
   - Maintain imperative/action-oriented language in tasks
   - Keep task context and assignee information (e.g., "TODO (Bob):")
6. Respond **with nothing else** — only the valid JSON.`;

export const extractOpenTasks = ({
  markdown,
}: {
  markdown: string;
}): string => `You are **Tasks Extraction Agent**.

GOAL
Extract ALL actionable tasks from the note and accurately classify their current STATUS.

STATUS DEFINITIONS
• **pending** – not started (empty checkbox "[ ]", "TODO:", or action item without completion marker)
• **in-progress** – actively being worked on (partial checkbox "[/]", "[-]", "IN PROGRESS:", "WIP:")
• **done** – completed (checked "[x]", "[X]", "✅", "DONE:", strikethrough text)

WHAT TO INCLUDE
✓ Tasks clearly assigned to the note author (me/current user)
✓ Action items in any format that represent work to be done
✓ Items with imperative verbs directed at the reader

FORMATS TO RECOGNIZE
1. **Checkbox Lists**
   - \`- [ ] Task\` → pending
   - \`- [/] Task\` or \`- [-] Task\` → in-progress
   - \`- [x] Task\` or \`- [X] Task\` → done
   
2. **Keyword Prefixes** (case-insensitive)
   - \`TODO: Task\` → pending
   - \`FIXME: Issue\` → pending
   - \`ACTION: Task\` → pending
   - \`NEXT: Task\` → pending
   - \`WIP: Task\` or \`IN PROGRESS: Task\` → in-progress
   - \`DONE: Task\` or \`COMPLETED: Task\` → done
   
3. **Bullet Lists with Action Verbs**
   - \`- Review the proposal\` → pending (if no completion marker)
   - \`- Call John about project\` → pending
   - \`* Send email to team\` → pending

SPECIAL RULES
1. **Heading-style TODOs**: If a line starts with "TODO:" and ends with a colon, followed by indented items:
   - Use the heading line as the task text
   - Ignore the indented explanatory bullets below it
   - Example: "TODO: Review Q4 budget:" → task = "Review Q4 budget"

2. **Assignee Detection**: 
   - Default: assume task is for me (the note author)
   - Skip if explicitly assigned to others: "TODO (Bob):", "Sarah to...", "→ John"
   - Include if assigned to me: "TODO (me):", "I need to..."

3. **Context Preservation**:
   - Include enough context to make the task actionable
   - "Fix bug" → "Fix bug in payment processing" (if context available)

WHAT TO EXCLUDE
✗ Questions without action ("What about X?")
✗ Meeting agenda items that are just topics
✗ Completed items in narrative text
✗ Hypothetical actions ("We could...")
✗ Tasks explicitly assigned to others

EXAMPLES
• "TODO: Follow up on the Shio acquisition" → { "text": "Follow up on the Shio acquisition", "status": "pending" }
• "- [/] Reviewing architecture docs" → { "text": "Reviewing architecture docs", "status": "in-progress" }
• "DONE: Submitted expense report" → { "text": "Submitted expense report", "status": "done" }
• "Bob to prepare slides" → SKIP (assigned to Bob)
• "What's the status?" → SKIP (question, not task)

OUTPUT
Return **strict JSON** with this exact schema:
{
  "tasks": [
    { "text": "string", "status": "pending | in-progress | done" }
  ]
}

NOTE START
${markdown}
NOTE END`;

GOAL
Synchronise the central Todo list with the latest tasks extracted from the note **${relPath}**.

INPUTS
• **Current todo.md content**:
${existing}

• **Tasks extracted from ${relPath}** (JSON array):
${tasksJson}

RULES
1. Each task line must include a checkbox and the backlink comment exactly as "<!-- from: ${relPath} -->".
2. Keep three sections headed "## Pending", "## In Progress", and "## Done" (create if missing). Put tasks in the correct section based on status.
3. Remove any existing task lines that contain the backlink for ${relPath} before inserting the new ones.
4. Preserve tasks that belong to other notes unchanged.
5. Keep the file title \`# TODO\` at the top.
6. Respond with **strict JSON** that matches the provided schema: { "markdown": "...updated todo.md..." }. Do not include any other keys or commentary.`;

  relPath,

}: {

  relPath: string;

}): string => `You are **Tasks Merge Agent v2**.

GOAL
Update the central task *lists* – not the markdown – for note **${relPath}**.

INPUTS
• Current lists JSON (all tasks in the todo file):
${existingListsJson}

• Tasks extracted from ${relPath} (JSON array):
${noteTasksJson}

RULES
1. Every task object has shape { "text": string, "from": string }.
2. Remove any task whose "from" equals "${relPath}" from all three arrays.
3. Insert every task from the new extraction into the correct array (pending → pending[], etc.).
4. Preserve tasks belonging to other notes untouched.
5. The arrays MUST remain de-duplicated (no identical {text, from}).

Respond with **strict JSON**:
{
  "pending":   [{"text": "...", "from": "..."}],
  "inProgress": [{...}],
  "done":       [{...}]
}`;
