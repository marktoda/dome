// submitProposal: the single user-facing write entry point.
//
// Per [[wiki/invariants/PROPOSALS_ARE_THE_ONLY_WRITE_PATH]], every write
// into trusted vault state — human, agent, garden processor, scheduled job —
// flows through this function. It composes the v1 engine stack against a
// caller-opened `VaultRuntime`:
//
//   1. Read the three DBs (projection / outbox / ledger) from the runtime.
//   2. Build the seven-sink `ApplyEffectSinks` via `buildSqliteSinks`,
//      injecting Phase 7a placeholders for `applyPatch` and `captureView`
//      (the two sinks not owned by the projection / outbox factories — see
//      `src/projections/sinks.ts` §"Two sinks are injected by the caller").
//   3. Call `adopt({ vault, proposal, runAdoptionProcessors, sinks, ledger })`
//      and return its `AdoptionResult` verbatim.
//
// Idempotency: per [[wiki/specs/proposals]] §"Submission API" and the
// adoption-loop's fixed-point semantics, calling `submitProposal` twice
// with the same `proposal.id` and the same `(base, head)` short-circuits
// on the second call — the candidate tree is already at the proposal's
// head, so the loop converges on iteration 1 with no engine writes. The
// second call's `AdoptionResult.adopted` is `true` (the adopted ref is
// already at `head`); no observable side effect occurs.
//
// Lifecycle: `submitProposal` does NOT open DBs. `openVaultRuntime` (in
// `./vault-runtime.ts`) is the open-side; the caller passes the opened
// handle in. Separating DB-open from per-call API surface lets a single
// VaultRuntime serve many submissions without re-opening sqlite per call.
//
// Phase 7a placeholders (documented inline at injection):
//   - `applyPatch`: throws on invocation. Phase 7b wires the candidate-
//     tree mutator that turns a routed `PatchEffect` into either a
//     working-tree write (adoption phase) or a new garden-Proposal (per
//     [[wiki/matrices/effect-router-targets]]).
//   - `captureView`: throws on invocation. Phase 7b/8 wires the view-
//     effect delivery surface (CLI stdout, MCP response, HTTP stream).
// The Phase 7a smoke test exercises only effect kinds that don't drive
// these two sinks (diagnostic, fact, question), so the throws never fire.
//
// `resolveTree` (the third Phase 7a seam) is NOT a placeholder — see
// `./vault-runtime.ts`'s `makeResolveTree`. The runtime calls it
// unconditionally per iteration when adoption-phase processors exist,
// so a throwing stub would break every submission with a non-empty
// registry.
//
// Phase 7b will retire the old `src/vault.ts`'s Tools-surface (writeDocument,
// patchRegion, etc.). For Phase 7a, submitProposal is strictly additive on
// top of v1 substrate — it does not replace any existing API.
//
// House-style notes (matches src/engine/adopt.ts, src/projections/sinks.ts,
// src/engine/closure-commit.ts):
//   - Banner cites the normative spec + the load-bearing invariant.
//   - `type X = { ... }` aliases (not `interface`), every field `readonly`.
//   - Imports limited to v1 substrate: `./adopt`, `./vault-runtime`,
//     `./apply-effect` (for the placeholder sink types), the `Proposal`
//     and `AdoptionResult` types from `../core/proposal`, and the sink
//     builder from `../projections/sinks`. The `Vault` type is needed by
//     `adopt({vault: Vault, ...})`; it's imported as a type-only import
//     (matches the existing pattern in `src/engine/runner-contract.ts`
//     and the engine tests) — type imports erase at runtime, so this does
//     not pull in any old-v0.5 runtime code.
