# Logging and Error Handling Improvements: Executive Summary

**Last Updated:** April 27, 2025

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Initial State and Identified Issues

Prior to the improvement initiative, the Dome repository exhibited several critical inconsistencies in logging and error handling:

- **Inconsistent Error Types**: Many services were using generic JavaScript `Error` objects instead of typed, domain-specific errors.
- **Ad-hoc Logging**: Services used a variety of logging approaches, including direct `console.log` statements without structured data.
- **Poor Request Tracing**: Limited or missing request ID propagation made tracing requests through multiple services difficult.
- **Inconsistent Error Responses**: API error responses varied in format across services, complicating client-side handling.
- **Inadequate Context**: Errors and logs often lacked sufficient contextual information for effective troubleshooting.
- **Missing Performance Metrics**: Limited operation tracking and performance measurement capabilities.

### 1.2 Goals and Objectives

The improvement project was designed to achieve the following objectives:

1. **Standardize Error Handling**: Implement a consistent error hierarchy and handling pattern across all services.
2. **Enhance Observability**: Improve logging with structured data, context propagation, and appropriate log levels.
3. **Facilitate Troubleshooting**: Enable efficient request tracing through distributed systems.
4. **Improve End-user Experience**: Provide consistent, meaningful error messages in API responses.
5. **Enable Performance Monitoring**: Integrate metrics collection for operations and error rates.
6. **Establish Best Practices**: Document and enforce consistent patterns for future development.

### 1.3 Approach and Methodology

The improvement project followed a systematic approach:

1. **Analysis Phase**: Comprehensive audit of existing logging and error handling across services.
2. **Architecture Design**: Creation of shared packages for logging (`@dome/logging`) and errors (`@dome/errors`).
3. **Implementation**: Service-by-service migration to the new architecture.
4. **Verification**: Development of automated verification scripts and tests.
5. **Documentation**: Creation of best practices documentation and examples.
6. **Monitoring**: Implementation of dashboards and alerts based on the new error and logging structure.

## 2. Shared Package Improvements

### 2.1 @dome/logging Package

The `@dome/logging` package provides a structured, context-aware logging system built on the following components:

- **Base Logger**: Built on the Pino logging library, configured for Cloudflare Workers environment.
- **Context Propagation**: Uses AsyncLocalStorage to maintain context across asynchronous operations.
- **Request Tracking**: Automatic logging of request start/end events with duration metrics.
- **Operation Tracking**: Specialized helpers for tracking operations with timing and success/failure metrics.
- **Hono Integration**: Seamless integration with the Hono web framework through middleware.
- **Metrics Collection**: Service-specific metrics tracking for counters, gauges, and timings.

Example implementation:

```typescript
// Setup in application entry point
import { initLogging } from '@dome/logging';
const app = new Hono();
initLogging(app, {
  idFactory: () => nanoid(12),
  extraBindings: { apiVersion: '2.0', environment: 'production' },
});

// Usage in controllers/services
import { getLogger, trackOperation } from '@dome/logging';

// Context-aware structured logging
getLogger().info({ userId, operation: 'createUser' }, 'User created successfully');

// Operation tracking with automatic timing
await trackOperation('userAuthentication', async () => {
  // Operation code here
  return result;
});
```

Key enhancements:

- Redaction of sensitive information in logs
- Consistent request ID propagation
- Service-specific metrics collection
- Standardized log levels with appropriate usage guidelines

### 2.2 @dome/errors Package

The `@dome/errors` package defines a consistent error hierarchy and handling mechanism:

- **Error Hierarchy**: Base `DomeError` class with specialized subclasses for different HTTP status codes.
- **Error Context**: Rich contextual information through `details` and error chaining with `cause`.
- **Error Middleware**: Standardized error handling middleware for Hono applications.
- **Error Conversion**: Utilities to convert generic errors to the appropriate DomeError type.
- **Error Factory**: Factory pattern for creating domain-specific error classes.

Example implementation:

```typescript
// Creating domain-specific errors
const SiloErrors = createErrorFactory('silo', { service: 'silo' });

// Using specialized error classes
throw new ValidationError('Invalid email format', { field: 'email' });

// Error chaining to preserve root causes
try {
  await db.query(sql);
} catch (error) {
  throw new InternalError('Database query failed', { operation: 'getUserProfile' }, error);
}

// Error middleware in application setup
app.use('*', errorHandler());
```

Key enhancements:

- Consistent HTTP status code mapping
- Standardized error response format
- Error assertion utilities
- Error type conversion and enrichment

### 2.3 New Utilities and Patterns

Several new utilities and patterns were introduced to improve error handling and logging:

- **logError**: Enhanced error logging with automatic error type extraction and consistent formatting.

- **sanitizeForLogging**: Utility to redact sensitive information before logging.
- **withLogger**: Create child loggers with additional context for specific operations.
- **assertValid/assertExists**: Validation helpers that throw appropriate errors.
- **toDomeError**: Convert any error to a properly typed DomeError.
- **Request ID propagation**: Utilities to maintain request context across service boundaries.

## 6. Best Practices and Standards

### 6.1 Established Patterns and Practices

The following patterns have been established as best practices:

- **Use Structured Logging**: Always use structured logging with object context.

  ```typescript
  // GOOD
  logger.info({ userId, operation: 'createUser', duration }, 'User created successfully');

  // AVOID
  logger.info(`User ${userId} created successfully in ${duration}ms`);
  ```

- **Use Appropriate Log Levels**:

  - `error`: Only for errors that impact functionality
  - `warn`: For issues that don't prevent operation but require attention
  - `info`: For normal operational information
  - `debug`: For detailed information useful for debugging (disable in production)

- **Use Specific Error Types**:

  ```typescript
  // GOOD
  throw new ValidationError('Invalid email format', { field: 'email' });

  // AVOID
  throw new Error('Invalid email format');
  ```

- **Chain Errors to Preserve Causes**:

  ```typescript
  try {
    await db.query(sql);
  } catch (error) {
    throw new InternalError('Database query failed', { operation: 'getUserProfile' }, error);
  }
  ```

- **Use logError Consistently**:
  ```typescript
  try {
    // operation
  } catch (error) {
    logError(error, 'Failed to process request', { requestId, userId });
    throw error; // or handle it
  }
  ```

### 6.2 Simplified Examples

#### Basic Logger Setup

```typescript
// Entry point
import { Hono } from 'hono';
import { initLogging, getLogger } from '@dome/logging';

const app = new Hono();
initLogging(app, {
  extraBindings: { service: 'api', version: '1.0.0' },
});

export default app;
```

#### Controller Implementation

```typescript
import { getLogger, trackOperation } from '@dome/logging';
import { ValidationError, NotFoundError } from '@dome/errors';

export async function getUserProfile(c) {
  const logger = getLogger();
  const userId = c.req.param('userId');

  logger.info({ userId }, 'Getting user profile');

  return await trackOperation('getUserProfile', async () => {
    if (!userId) {
      throw new ValidationError('User ID is required');
    }

    const user = await userService.findById(userId);

    if (!user) {
      throw new NotFoundError(`User with ID ${userId} not found`);
    }

    return c.json(user);
  });
}
```

#### Error Middleware Setup

```typescript
import { Hono } from 'hono';
import { initLogging } from '@dome/logging';
import { errorHandler } from '@dome/errors';

const app = new Hono();
initLogging(app);

// Apply error handling middleware
app.use('*', errorHandler());

// Routes here...

export default app;
```
