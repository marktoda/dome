## Getting Started

The Chat RAG Graph solution is built on a modular, graph-based architecture that processes user queries through a series of specialized nodes. Each node performs a specific function, such as query analysis, document retrieval, tool execution, or response generation.

As a developer, you can:

- Configure the existing system to meet your specific requirements
- Add new tools to extend the system's capabilities
- Create new nodes to implement custom processing logic
- Modify the graph structure to change the flow of execution
- Test and debug the system to ensure reliability and performance

The guides in this section provide detailed instructions for each of these tasks, with code examples and best practices.

## Development Workflow

A typical development workflow for the Chat RAG Graph solution includes:

1. **Setup**: Set up the development environment with the necessary tools and dependencies
2. **Configuration**: Configure the system for your specific use case
3. **Development**: Implement new features or modify existing ones
4. **Testing**: Test your changes to ensure they work as expected
5. **Debugging**: Debug any issues that arise during testing
6. **Deployment**: Deploy your changes to production

The guides in this section cover each of these steps in detail, providing a comprehensive reference for developers working with the system.

## Best Practices

When working with the Chat RAG Graph solution, consider these best practices:

- **Modularity**: Keep nodes focused on a single responsibility
- **Immutability**: Use immutable update patterns for state transformations
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling in all components
- **Observability**: Add logging and metrics to track performance and behavior
- **Testing**: Write comprehensive tests for all components
- **Documentation**: Document your changes and additions

Following these practices will help ensure that the system remains maintainable, extensible, and reliable as it evolves.
