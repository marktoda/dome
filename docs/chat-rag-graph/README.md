## About Chat RAG Graph

The Chat RAG Graph is a sophisticated conversational AI system that combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a flexible graph-based execution model. It enables dynamic, context-aware conversations with access to user-specific knowledge bases and external tools.

Built on a modular architecture, the system processes user queries through a series of specialized nodes that handle tasks like query rewriting, document retrieval, tool selection, and response generation. The graph-based approach allows for dynamic routing based on query characteristics, ensuring optimal handling of each user interaction.
