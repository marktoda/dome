## Introduction

The Chat RAG Graph solution is a next-generation conversational AI system that combines the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in a flexible, graph-based execution model. This approach enables dynamic, context-aware conversations that can leverage both user-specific knowledge bases and external tools.

The system is designed to address common challenges in conversational AI systems, such as:

- Providing accurate, contextually relevant responses
- Handling complex, multi-part queries
- Integrating with external knowledge sources and tools
- Maintaining conversation context over time
- Ensuring transparent, explainable responses
- Optimizing performance and resource usage

By implementing a graph-based execution model, the Chat RAG Graph solution can dynamically route queries through different processing nodes based on the specific requirements of each interaction, resulting in more intelligent, helpful, and efficient conversations.
