# Logging and Error Handling Verification Plan

**Last Updated:** April 27, 2025

## Overview

This document outlines the verification and testing plan for the logging and error handling improvements across the Dome platform. It covers the automated verification scripts, test cases, integration tests, and documentation that ensure consistent implementation and behavior across all services.

## 1. Verification Scripts

### 1.1 Compliance Scanning (`scripts/verify-logging-errors.js`)

We've created a comprehensive verification script that:

- Scans all services for proper usage of `@dome/logging` and `@dome/common/errors` packages
- Identifies any remaining `console.log` statements or non-standard error handling patterns
- Verifies consistent use of `logError`, request ID propagation, and structured logging
- Checks for appropriate log level usage across services
- Generates a detailed report in the `docs/LOGGING_VERIFICATION.md` file

The script provides:

- Service-by-service overview of compliance
- Detailed lists of files with issues
- Technical debt tracking for future cleanup

**Usage:**

```bash
node scripts/verify-logging-errors.js
```

## 2. Test Suites

### 2.1 Error Handling Tests

#### 2.1.1 Unit Tests (`packages/errors/tests/error-handling.test.ts`)

Comprehensive unit tests for the error handling library covering:

- Base `DomeError` class and all error subclasses
- Error conversion utilities (`toDomeError`)
- Error wrapping and assertion utilities
- Database error handling
- Error factory functionality
- Error handler middleware

#### 2.1.2 Error Propagation Tests (`packages/errors/tests/error-propagation.test.ts`)

Tests that verify error propagation across service boundaries:

- Request ID propagation through service calls
- Error context preservation across service boundaries
- Error enrichment at each service level
- End-to-end error handling with middleware integration
- Error standardization across multiple services

### 2.2 Logging Tests

#### 2.2.1 Core Functionality Tests (`packages/logging/tests/logging-functionality.test.ts`)

Tests covering core logging functionality:

- Logger creation and configuration
- Operation logging helpers (`logOperationStart`, `logOperationSuccess`, `logOperationFailure`)
- Operation tracking with automatic timing
- External API call logging
- Request ID propagation in fetch requests
- Service metrics collection

#### 2.2.2 Middleware Integration Tests (`packages/logging/tests/middleware-integration.test.ts`)

Tests that verify the integration of logging with middleware and cross-service communication:

- Logger context injection in middleware
- Request ID propagation across service boundaries
- End-to-end request flow with proper context maintenance
- Error handling with context preservation
- Nested operation tracking with context inheritance

## 3. Test Coverage

## 4. Integration Verification

### 4.1 Cross-Service Tests

The integration tests specifically verify:

- Request ID propagation across service boundaries
- Context preservation throughout the request chain
- Error propagation and enrichment across service boundaries
- Structured logging consistency across services
- Metrics collection across service operations

### 4.2 End-to-End Test Scenarios

1. **Happy Path Flow**

   - Request flows through multiple services
   - Request ID is properly propagated
   - Operations are tracked with timing and context
   - Successful response is returned

2. **Error Handling Flow**
   - Error occurs in a downstream service
   - Error is properly contextualized and propagated
   - Error details and request context are preserved
   - Appropriate status codes and error formats are returned

## 5. Service Compliance Status

As of the latest verification run, service compliance status is:

- ðŸŸ¡ Partially compliant (some issues)
- ðŸ”´ Non-compliant (significant issues)

## 6. Technical Debt

The following items have been identified as technical debt that should be addressed in future sprints:

### 6.1 Code Quality Issues

- Replace remaining `console.log` statements in the `chat` service
- Update `tsunami` service to use `@dome/logging` and `@dome/common/errors`
- Implement request ID propagation in `tsunami` service
- Standardize error handling in all RPC calls between services

### 6.2 Test Coverage Gaps

- Add more integration tests for error handling between specific services
- Create load tests to verify logging performance under high traffic
- Add tests for log rotation and log persistence

### 6.3 Documentation Improvements

- Document standard log levels and when to use each
- Create a troubleshooting guide using error codes
- Document metrics collection and alerting based on errors

## 7. Next Steps

1. **Run Verification Script in CI/CD Pipeline**

   - Add the verification script to the CI/CD pipeline
   - Fail builds when new violations are introduced

2. **Address Technical Debt**

   - Prioritize fixing the `tsunami` service
   - Remove all remaining `console.log` statements

3. **Enhance Monitoring**

   - Set up alerts based on error rates
   - Create dashboards for monitoring error patterns

4. **Regular Audits**
   - Schedule monthly audits of logging and error handling
   - Track improvements over time

## Conclusion

The comprehensive verification and testing plan ensures consistent logging and error handling across all services in the Dome platform. By implementing these tests and scripts, we can maintain high-quality error reporting, consistent log formats, and reliable request tracing throughout the system.

The test suite provides confidence that errors are properly propagated, contextualized, and reported, making debugging and monitoring more effective. The verification script enables ongoing monitoring of compliance with best practices.

While there are still some areas of technical debt to address, the overall architecture for logging and error handling is robust and well-tested.
