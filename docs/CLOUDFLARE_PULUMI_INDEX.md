# Cloudflare Infrastructure as Code with Pulumi

## Introduction

This documentation set provides a comprehensive plan for implementing infrastructure as code (IaC) using Pulumi to manage our Cloudflare resources. The goal is to transition from manual deployments to a fully automated, version-controlled infrastructure deployment process.

## Documentation Structure

This documentation set consists of the following documents:

1. **[CLOUDFLARE_PULUMI_SUMMARY.md](./CLOUDFLARE_PULUMI_SUMMARY.md)**
   - Executive summary
   - Key benefits
   - Resource inventory
   - Implementation roadmap
   - Getting started guide

2. **[CLOUDFLARE_PULUMI_ARCHITECTURE.md](./CLOUDFLARE_PULUMI_ARCHITECTURE.md)**
   - Detailed architecture overview
   - Cloudflare resource inventory
   - Pulumi project structure
   - Technology stack
   - Dependencies and prerequisites
   - Migration strategy
   - Best practices
   - Security considerations

3. **[CLOUDFLARE_PULUMI_IMPLEMENTATION.md](./CLOUDFLARE_PULUMI_IMPLEMENTATION.md)**
   - Detailed implementation guidance
   - Code examples for each component
   - Project setup instructions
   - Resource implementation details
   - Environment configuration
   - CI/CD integration

4. **[CLOUDFLARE_PULUMI_DIAGRAM.md](./CLOUDFLARE_PULUMI_DIAGRAM.md)**
   - Visual diagrams of the infrastructure
   - Pulumi project structure visualization
   - Migration process flowchart
   - Deployment workflow diagram

## Quick Start

To get started with the implementation:

1. Review the [summary document](./CLOUDFLARE_PULUMI_SUMMARY.md) for an overview of the plan
2. Explore the [architecture document](./CLOUDFLARE_PULUMI_ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed design decisions
3. Follow the [implementation document](./CLOUDFLARE_PULUMI_IMPLEMENTATION.md) for code examples and setup instructions
4. Refer to the [diagram document](./CLOUDFLARE_PULUMI_DIAGRAM.md) for visual representations

## Implementation Timeline

The implementation is planned to be completed in 7 weeks:

- **Weeks 1**: Setup and Foundation
- **Weeks 2-3**: Worker and Queue Implementation
- **Week 4**: Environment Configuration and Testing
- **Weeks 5-6**: Migration and Integration
- **Week 7**: Documentation and Training

## Next Steps

1. Set up the Pulumi project structure in `./infra/`
2. Install prerequisites (Pulumi CLI, Node.js, pnpm)
3. Configure Cloudflare API tokens
4. Begin implementing core resources (D1 databases, R2 buckets)

## Conclusion

This documentation set provides a comprehensive plan for implementing infrastructure as code using Pulumi for our Cloudflare resources. By following this plan, we can successfully transition to a more reliable, reproducible, and automated infrastructure management approach.
