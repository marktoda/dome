# TUI Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the improvements made to the Dome Chat TUI based on the design document in `./docs/tui-architecture.md`.

## Completed Improvements

### 1. State Management (✅ Completed)

- Implemented centralized state management using React Context + useReducer pattern
- Created proper type definitions in `src/cli/state/types.ts`
- Implemented separate reducers for chat, activity, and UI state
- Added AppContext provider for global state management

### 2. Character-by-Character Streaming (✅ Completed)

- Created `useStream` hook for smooth character streaming at 30 fps
- Implemented blinking cursor (▊) during streaming
- Added proper queue management for incoming text chunks
- Cursor blinks every 500ms as specified

### 3. Component Architecture (✅ Completed)

- Refactored all components to use new state management
- Proper separation of concerns with dedicated hooks and services
- Components now properly consume state through context hooks

### 4. Worker Thread Indexing (✅ Completed)

- Implemented `IndexWorker` service using Node.js worker_threads
- Created dedicated worker script at `src/cli/worker/indexer.ts`
- Added auto-restart logic with exponential backoff
- Progress reporting integrated with state management

### 5. Error Handling & Resilience (✅ Completed)

- Added `withRetry` utility for network operations
- Implemented exponential backoff (max 2 retries)
- Enhanced error messages with context-aware descriptions
- Worker crash recovery with automatic restart attempts

### 6. Performance Optimization (✅ Completed)

- Added React.memo to all components
- Implemented message limiting (50 messages max)
- Activity list capped at 100 entries
- Optimized re-render frequency for indexing status

### 7. Color Scheme Updates (✅ Completed)

- Updated all components to use centralized color constants
- Implemented 24-bit RGB colors as specified:
  - [You]: #00d7d7 'cyan'
  - [Dome]: #ff00ff 'magenta'
  - [System]: #5f87ff 'blue'
  - [Error]: #ff5f5f 'red'
  - Tool activity: #00d7d7 (cyan)
  - Document activity: #5fff87 (green)

## Key Files Modified

### State Management

- `src/cli/state/types.ts` - Type definitions
- `src/cli/state/chatReducer.ts` - Chat state logic
- `src/cli/state/activityReducer.ts` - Activity tracking
- `src/cli/state/rootReducer.ts` - Combined reducer
- `src/cli/state/AppContext.tsx` - Context provider

### Hooks

- `src/cli/hooks/useStream.ts` - Character streaming
- `src/cli/hooks/useVaultIndexer.ts` - Worker integration
- `src/cli/hooks/useMessageRenderer.ts` - Message optimization

### Services

- `src/cli/services/IndexWorker.ts` - Worker management
- `src/cli/utils/errorHandler.ts` - Error handling utilities

### Worker

- `src/cli/worker/indexer.ts` - Background indexing worker

### Components (All Updated)

- `src/cli/components/ChatApp.tsx` - Main app component
- `src/cli/components/ChatHistory.tsx` - Message display
- `src/cli/components/ActivityPanel.tsx` - Activity monitor
- `src/cli/components/BottomStatusBar.tsx` - Indexing status
- `src/cli/components/HelpPanel.tsx` - Help display
- `src/cli/components/InputArea.tsx` - User input
- `src/cli/components/MarkdownRenderer.tsx` - Markdown rendering
- `src/cli/components/StatusBar.tsx` - Header status
- `src/cli/components/FullscreenLayout.tsx` - Layout manager

### Constants

- `src/cli/constants.ts` - Centralized configuration

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns with dedicated state management
2. **Performance**: Optimized rendering with React.memo and controlled state updates
3. **Reliability**: Worker threads prevent UI blocking during indexing
4. **User Experience**: Smooth character streaming creates engaging interaction
5. **Consistency**: Centralized color scheme ensures visual coherence
6. **Extensibility**: Modular architecture makes adding features straightforward

## Future Considerations

The architecture now supports the future enhancements mentioned in the design document:

- Multi-vault switching (state structure supports it)
- Mouse-based selection (component structure ready)
- Inline syntax highlighting (MarkdownRenderer can be extended)
- Live-share over SSH (state management is serializable)
- Hot-reloading config (context pattern supports it)

The implementation successfully follows the design document while maintaining the existing functionality of the Mastra agent chat system.
