# Consumer surface matrix

The canonical map of "what each consumer shell imports from the `@dome/sdk` package family." Rows are consumer shells (v0.5-shipped and v1+ anticipated); columns are exported symbol families. Each cell names the entrypoint the consumer reaches the symbol through, or marks the symbol unused for that shell.

**Note on the MCP server row.** Per the compiler reframe ([[VISION]] §"Two surface patterns" and [[wiki/specs/mcp-surface]] §"Status in v0.5"), the MCP server is preserved in the codebase as a non-primary surface in v0.5 — agentic harnesses interact with Dome primarily through the compiler boundary (`AGENTS.md` + CLI + daemon + reconcile) rather than through MCP-routed tool calls. The MCP row remains in the matrix because the code still exists and its import topology is still accurate; the row's *non-primary status* lives in the prose specs, not in the cell labels.

The matrix is the structural realization of [[wiki/invariants/CORE_HAS_NO_LLM_OR_MCP_DEPENDENCY]]: every cell that reads `core` carries no transitive Anthropic/MCP dependency; every cell that reads `workflows` or `mcp` opts into that dep explicitly.

The matrix also realizes the two-layer aggregation introduced in [[wiki/specs/sdk-surface]] §"Consumer surfaces": **`AbstractSurface`** (protocol-agnostic, in core) + **per-protocol renderers** (`renderMcp` in mcp; future `renderHttp` in http; future `renderVoice` in voice). A consumer that aggregates the four kinds (tools, prompts, resources, instructions) for one consumer reaches the abstract layer through `core` and the protocol-specific rendering through the protocol's entrypoint.

## Entrypoint legend

- `core` — `@dome/sdk` (the package root: `src/index.ts`). No LLM, no MCP. Carries `AbstractSurface`, `buildAbstractSurface(vault)`, `PromptDescriptor`, `ResourceDescriptor`.
- `workflows` — `@dome/sdk/workflows`. Carries `@ai-sdk/anthropic` + `ai`.
- `mcp` — `@dome/sdk/mcp`. Carries `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`. Carries `renderMcp(surface)`, `McpSurface`, `ToolAdapter`, `McpPromptAdapter`, `ResourceAdapter`, `DomeMcpServer`.
- `cli` — `@dome/sdk/cli`. Carries `commander`.
- `core + <entrypoint>` — **compound cell.** The consumer reaches the symbol through more than one entrypoint (e.g., `AbstractSurface` from core + `renderMcp` from mcp). The bundling-axiom test treats each named entrypoint as a separate transitive-dep contributor: a compound `core + mcp` cell pulls the MCP deps; `core + workflows` pulls the LLM deps. A cell labeled just `core` must reach its symbol through `core` *only*.
- `—` — symbol unused by this shell.
- Speculative entrypoints (`future-http`, `future-voice`) appear inline as non-normative annotations only — they are not in the legend; they ride as parenthetical hints in cell text where the future surface is anticipated.

## Matrix

| Consumer shell ↓ \ Symbol family → | Vault (`openVault`, `Vault`) | Document (`makeDocument`) | Tools (`readDocument` … `deleteDocument`, `BoundToolSurface`) | Hook (`HookRegistry`, `HookDispatcher`, `HookContext`) | Reconcile + Watcher | Privileged writer (internal — `vault.rebuildIndex` seam only) | AI-SDK ToolSet (`projectAiSdk`) | Workflow runner (`runWorkflow`, `WorkflowRegistry`, `PromptLoader`) | AbstractSurface (`buildAbstractSurface`, `PromptDescriptor`, `ResourceDescriptor`) | Protocol renderer (`renderMcp`; future `renderHttp`, `renderVoice`) | `DomeMcpServer` | CLI shell (`runCli`, `dome*` commands, `CliError`, `renderCliError`) |

| **Future HTTP** (v1+ — web-app backend) | `core` | `core` | `core` (via `surface.tools`; a future `renderHttp` would wrap the same `BoundToolSurface` as REST handlers) | — | — | — | — | `workflows` (if the web app surfaces workflows) | `core` (the abstract aggregation layer the HTTP shell consumes) | `future-http` (a `renderHttp(surface)` in `@dome/sdk/http` would project the four kinds to HTTP envelopes) | — | — |
| **Plugin SDK** (v0.5+ — custom Tool authors) | `core` (types only) | `core` (types only) | `core` (types only) | `core` (registration types) | — | — | `workflows` (when the plugin wants an AI-SDK-shaped Tool) | — | — | — | — | — |

## Reading the matrix

- **A consumer whose row has only `core` and `—` cells** transitively pulls only the dependencies in [[wiki/specs/sdk-surface]] §"Dependencies" entrypoint-scope `core`: `isomorphic-git`, `chokidar`, `zod`, `gray-matter`, `p-queue`, `yaml`, `zod-to-json-schema`. No LLM, no MCP, no Commander. The bundle-deps test pins this for the `@dome/sdk` entrypoint itself; a consumer that respects the cell labels gets the same guarantee transitively.
- **A row with a `workflows` cell or a `core + workflows` compound cell** adds `@ai-sdk/anthropic` + `ai`. The mobile and voice-capture rows deliberately omit this — they capture-and-store, they don't drive the LLM loop.
- **A row with an `mcp` cell or a `core + mcp` compound cell** adds `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`. The CLI and eval rows omit it — the CLI invokes the headless agent loop directly; eval doesn't speak MCP.
- **The AbstractSurface column is always `core` or `—`.** That's the structural shape the entrypoint split makes possible: the protocol-agnostic aggregation lives in core, so every shell that aggregates the four kinds reaches it through `core` regardless of which protocol it renders to.
- **The Protocol renderer column names which renderer the consumer uses.** `mcp` (live in v0.5), `future-http`, `future-voice` (anticipated, non-normative). A consumer that doesn't aggregate the four kinds has `—` here.
- **Compound cells (`core + <entrypoint>`)** mean the consumer's import of that symbol family spans two entrypoints. Example: the MCP server's overall consumer-surface posture is `core` (for `AbstractSurface`) + `mcp` (for `renderMcp` and `DomeMcpServer`) — the abstract layer comes from core; the protocol projection comes from mcp.
- **Speculative entrypoints in cell text** (`future-http`, `future-voice`) are intentionally non-normative annotations: the matrix says "when this entrypoint exists, this is where the symbol would live" without committing v0.5 to ship it.

## Why the matrix exists

The architecture review found that pre-Phase-B, every consumer shell pulled Anthropic + MCP whether they used the LLM-driven surface or not (see [[wiki/gotchas/transitive-llm-dependency]]). The matrix is the substrate-shape pin that makes the entrypoint split legible: a reader asking "should `runWorkflow` live in core?" reads the column, sees that only the CLI, MCP server, headless loop, and eval suite need it, notices the mobile/voice/HTTP rows don't, and concludes the workflow runner belongs in `@dome/sdk/workflows`.

The matrix is also the input the [[wiki/invariants/CORE_HAS_NO_LLM_OR_MCP_DEPENDENCY]] bundle-deps test asserts against: any cell that reads `core` for an LLM-or-MCP-adjacent symbol family would be a contradiction.

The **two-layer split** (`AbstractSurface` in core; per-protocol renderers in their entrypoints) is the structural shape that makes v1+ multi-surface work cheap. A new protocol adapter ships as a single `renderXxx(surface): XxxSurface` function in its own entrypoint; the aggregation logic is reused. Without the split, every new protocol would re-implement the four-kind aggregation against `Vault` directly — and would inevitably duplicate the per-Vault prompt-directory scan, the hook-dispatch wrap, and the instructions composition.

## Cells that may grow

- **A new shell** (e.g., a CLI-but-not-the-built-in dome CLI, like a `dome-todo` companion) adds a row. The author follows the cell pattern: import only what you use; aggregate via `AbstractSurface` + a renderer if applicable.
- **A new entrypoint** (e.g., `@dome/sdk/http`) adds a renderer column entry and may replace a "future-" annotation. The split criterion: new entrypoints land when they (a) add a meaningful transitive dependency that consumers should opt into, OR (b) introduce a new protocol renderer parallel to `renderMcp`.
- **A new symbol family** (e.g., a future plugin-discovery API) adds a column of cells. The default cell value is `core` unless the symbol has consumer-affecting deps.
